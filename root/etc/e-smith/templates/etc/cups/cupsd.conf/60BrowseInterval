# BrowseInterval: the time between browsing updates in seconds.  Default
# is 30 seconds.
#
# Note that browsing information is sent whenever a printer's state changes
# as well, so this represents the maximum time between updates.
#
# Set this to 0 to disable outgoing broadcasts so your local printers are
# not advertised but you can still see printers on other hosts.
