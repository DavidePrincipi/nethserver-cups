#
# Access permissions for each directory served by the scheduler.
# Locations are relative to DocumentRoot...
#
# AuthType: the authorization to use:
#
#    None   - Perform no authentication
#    Basic  - Perform authentication using the HTTP Basic method.
#    Digest - Perform authentication using the HTTP Digest method.
#
#    (Note: local certificate authentication can be substituted by
#           the client for Basic or Digest when connecting to the
#           localhost interface)
#
# AuthClass: the authorization class; currently only "Anonymous", "User",
# "System" (valid user belonging to group SystemGroup), and "Group"
# (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported.
#
# AuthGroupName: the group name for "Group" authorization.
#
# Order: the order of Allow/Deny processing.
#
# Allow: allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address,
# network, or interface.
#
# Deny: denies access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address,
# network, or interface.
#
# Both "Allow" and "Deny" accept the following notations for addresses:
#
#     All
#     None
#     *.domain.com
#     .domain.com
#     host.domain.com
#     nnn.*
#     nnn.nnn.*
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.*
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mm
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mmm.mmm.mmm.mmm
#     @LOCAL
#     @IF(name)
#
# The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups
# with "HostNameLookups On" above.
#
# The @LOCAL address allows or denies from all non point-to-point
# interfaces.  For example, if you have a LAN and a dial-up link,
# @LOCAL could allow connections from the LAN but not from the dial-up
# link.  Similarly, the @IF(name) address allows or denies from the
# named network interface, e.g. @IF(eth0) under Linux.  Interfaces are
# refreshed automatically (no more than once every 60 seconds), so
# they can be used on dynamically-configured interfaces, e.g. PPP,
# 802.11, etc.
#
# Encryption: whether or not to use encryption; this depends on having
# the OpenSSL library linked into the CUPS library and scheduler.
#
# Possible values:
#
#     Always       - Always use encryption (SSL)
#     Never        - Never use encryption
#     Required     - Use TLS encryption upgrade
#     IfRequested  - Use encryption if the server requests it
#
# The default value is "IfRequested".
