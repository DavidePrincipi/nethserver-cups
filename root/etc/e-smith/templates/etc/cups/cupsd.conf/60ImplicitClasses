#
# ImplicitClasses: whether or not to use implicit classes.
#
# Printer classes can be specified explicitly in the classes.conf
# file, implicitly based upon the printers available on the LAN, or
# both.
#
# When ImplicitClasses is On, printers on the LAN with the same name
# (e.g. Acme-LaserPrint-1000) will be put into a class with the same
# name. This allows you to setup multiple redundant queues on a LAN
# without a lot of administrative difficulties.  If a user sends a
# job to Acme-LaserPrint-1000, the job will go to the first available
# queue.
#
# Enabled by default.
