# ImplicitAnyClasses: whether or not to create "AnyPrinter" implicit
# classes.
#
# When ImplicitAnyClasses is On and a local queue of the same name
# exists, e.g. "printer", "printer@server1", "printer@server1", then
# an implicit class called "Anyprinter" is created instead.
#
# When ImplicitAnyClasses is Off, implicit classes are not created
# when there is a local queue of the same name.
#
# Disabled by default.
