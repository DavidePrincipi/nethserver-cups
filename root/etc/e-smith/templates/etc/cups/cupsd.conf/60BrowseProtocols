#
# BrowseProtocols: which protocols to use for browsing.  Can be
# any of the following separated by whitespace and/or commas:
#
#     all  - Use all supported protocols.
#     cups - Use the CUPS browse protocol.
#     slp  - Use the SLPv2 protocol.
#
# The default is "cups".
#
# NOTE: If you choose to use SLPv2, it is *strongly* recommended that
#       you have at least one SLP Directory Agent (DA) on your
#       network.  Otherwise, browse updates can take several seconds,
#       during which the scheduler will not respond to client
#       requests.
