# User/Group: the user and group the server runs under.  Normally this
# must be lp and sys, however you can configure things for another
# user or group as needed.
#
# Note: the server must be run initially as root to support the
# default IPP port of 631.  It changes users whenever an external
# program is run, or if the RunAsUser directive is specified...
