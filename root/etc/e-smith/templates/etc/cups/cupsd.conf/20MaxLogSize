# MaxLogSize: controls the maximum size of each log file before they are
# rotated.  Defaults to 1048576 (1MB).  Set to 0 to disable log rotating.
#
# Note from the packager: this very high value is correct. Under normal
# circumstances the logs are rotated by logrotate, not cupsd. As a failsafe
# measure we have cupsd rotate a log if for some odd reason it approaches a
# common filesystem limit of 2GB before logrotate gets around to rotating it.
