# HideImplicitMembers: whether or not to show the members of an
# implicit class.
#
# When HideImplicitMembers is On, any remote printers that are
# part of an implicit class are hidden from the user, who will
# then only see a single queue even though many queues will be
# supporting the implicit class.
#
# Enabled by default.
