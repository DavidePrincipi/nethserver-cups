# Ports/addresses that we listen to.  The default port 631 is reserved
# for the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) and is what we use here.
#
# You can have multiple Port/Listen lines to listen to more than one
# port or address, or to restrict access:
#
#    Port 80
#    Port 631
#    Listen hostname
#    Listen hostname:80
#    Listen hostname:631
#    Listen 1.2.3.4
#    Listen 1.2.3.4:631
#
# NOTE: Unfortunately, most web browsers don't support TLS or HTTP Upgrades
# for encryption.  If you want to support web-based encryption you'll
# probably need to listen on port 443 (the "https" port...)
#
# NOTE 2: In order for the command-line and web interfaces to work, you
# must have at least one Port or Listen line that allows access from the
# local loopback address (localhost).
#

#Port 80
#Port 443
#Port 631
